Question 5 : "Explain RUN vs CMD vs Entrypoint?"

Answer 5: The "run" command is a build time command which is used in the image build step. The "CMD" and "Entrypoint" are 
run time command. The purpose of entrypoint is to specify which first command should run when a container we run a container. 
The entrypoint can be changed at the runtime. We can the "Entrypoint" when we starts the conainter. On the other hand, the CMD
specifies which default command should run at the start of the container.

I have used both Entrypoint and Cmd in a Dockerfile where I gave the value of "echo" to entrypoint and "Hello" to the cmd. After I 
run the Dockerfile, it prints hello on the screen in a ubuntu conainter.
