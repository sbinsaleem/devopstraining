The git is a distributed version control system to maintain all versions of code / documents of 
differnt developers in a repository.
Normally, the git has two respository. One is on the local machine of the developer where he copies the 
original or main branch of the code. The developer do changes to this branch and when is satifised that the 
code is complete and error free then it commits to the remote repository. In this way, the differnet developers
work on the local copies of the code in parallel and then they commit the code to the remote respository.
Practially, the developers install git version control on their local machines and they have accounts on the 
github (the remote repository). The github is used to push the finished code from the local repositories.
