In the docker architecture, we have three components namely "docker client", "docker daemon" and "docker registry".
These three components have seperate roles in the docker. The docker client is responsible to run the containers 
from the docker daemon. The docker client is an example of a simple CRI (Container Runtime Interface) that interacts 
with the docker daemon. The docker daemon runs on the operating system responsible to create, run and monitor containers 
and to build and pull images. The third componet of the docker architecture is docker registry that is a central respository 
to hold all the docker images from where users can pull and use the existing images. The registry can be public and private 
according to the needs of the organization.
