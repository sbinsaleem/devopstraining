Question 3 : "What are multi-stage builds?"

Answer 3: 

In a multi-stage build, we can have multiple stages to build an image in a Dockerfile. In the first stage, we normally build the artefact, 
application or executable and in the second stage we use that executable or created artefact to made the final image.

In the multstage build, the final image will be made from the last "FROM" command used in a Dockerfile. 

keeping the docker image size down is one of the challenge for building images, The each instruction in the Dockerfile adds a layer 
to the image, and you need to remember to clean up any artifacts you don’t need before moving on to the next layer. A common practice 
is to have one Dockerfile to use for development (which contained everything needed to build your application), and a smaller Dockerfile  
for production. The smaller file only contain your application and exactly what is needed to run it.

The multi stage building solves this problem which means we  use multiple "FROM" statements in a Dockerfile, the each "FROM" 
instruction can use a different base. The each "FORM" statement begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts 
from one stage to another which means leaving behind everything you don’t want in the final image.
