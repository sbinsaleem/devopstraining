Question 6 : "Improve the Dockerfile for python Application given in slides using the Dockerfile &
then improve it and share image size & estimated build time for it"

Answer 6: 

Before the execution of anything, the following is the status of my folder.

*****
devopstraining@devopstraining:~/gitworkspace/docker-samples/bad-practices-images/cached-layers$ ls
app.py  Dockerfile  index.html
devopstraining@devopstraining:~/gitworkspace/docker-samples/bad-practices-images/cached-layers$ nano Dockerfile
devopstraining@devopstraining:~/gitworkspace/docker-samples/bad-practices-images/cached-layers$ 
*****

Now, I am running the bad-practice dockerfile to show it's build time. The name of bad practice dockerfile is "Dockerfile".

The problem with the answer of this question is the installation of builx. In my OS and docker, I could not install the Builx, though I 
tried many-times. Therefore, I could not see the image build time and could not completely answer this question. Given, I have limited
time, I have decided to attempt this question at some later stage.
