The following three methods of git are used for reset.

1) The first method is called "mixed" reset which is a default method.
In this method, we remove commit from the local repository and 
changes from the staging area.

2) The second method is called "soft" reset. In this method the commit
is removed from the local repository but files remain in the staging
area.

3) The third method is called "hard" reset. In this method the changes
are removed from the local repository, staging area and the local files.
