There are three major sections of the git.The first section is called
"Working Directory". The second section is called "Staging area".The third section
is called "local repository". It is also called the ".git directory".
This lead to three following stages of git.

1) The modified stage which means that you have changed 
the file but have not committed it to your local respository.
2) The staged stage means that you 
marked your file ready to commit but still have not commityed it
to the local respository 
3)The committed stage means that you commit the stages to your
local repository.
